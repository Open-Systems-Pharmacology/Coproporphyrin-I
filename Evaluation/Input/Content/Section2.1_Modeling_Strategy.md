The general concept of building a PBPK model has previously been described by Kuepfer et al. ([Kuepfer 2016](#5-references)). Relevant information on anthropometric (height, weight) and physiological parameters (e.g. blood flows, organ volumes, binding protein concentrations, hematocrit, cardiac output) in adults was gathered from the literature and has been previously published ([Willmann 2007](#5-references)). The information was incorporated into PK-Sim® and was used as default values for the simulations in adults.

The applied activity and variability of plasma proteins and active processes that are integrated into PK-Sim® are described in the publicly available PK-Sim® Ontogeny Database Version 7.3 ([PK-Sim Ontogeny Database Version 7.3](#5-references)) or otherwise referenced for the specific process.

A mean model was built based on clinical data from studies of baseline Coproporphyrin-I and after administation of OATP1B perpetrators by Mori 2020 ([Mori 2020](#5-references)), Takehara 2018 ([Takehara 2018](#5-references)), Lai 2016 ([Lai 2016](#5-references)) and Zhang 2020 ([Zhang 2020](#5-references)). The studies reported mean plasma concentrations of Coproporphyrin-I. The mean PBPK model was developed using a mean individual based on the demographic data for each study. If no demographic data were provided, the following values were used: male, European, 30 years of age, 73 kg body weight and 176 cm body height. The relative tissue-specific expressions of the enzyme and transporter predominantly being involved in the metabolism/transport of Coproporphyrin-I (OATP1B1 and MRP2) were considered ([Meyer 2012](#5-references)). A zero-order infusion  of 1.09 mg/kg over one year were applied to model the synthesis rate of Coproporphyrin-I ([Mochizuki 2022](#5-references)). 

A specific set of parameters (see below) was optimized to describe the disposition of Coproporphyrin-I using the Parameter Identification module provided in PK-Sim®. Structural model selection was mainly guided by visual inspection and total error of the resulting description of data, 95% confidence interval of the identified parameter values and biological plausibility.

Details about input data (physicochemical, *in vitro* and clinical) can be found in [Section 2.2](#22-data-used).

Details about the structural model and its parameters can be found in [Section 2.3](#23-model-parameters-and-assumptions).
