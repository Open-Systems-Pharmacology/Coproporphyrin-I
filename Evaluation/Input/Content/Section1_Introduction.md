Coproporphyrin-I is an endogenous biomarker for OATP1B1 transport, as this is the main route of excretion of Coproporphyrin-I in combination with elimination via MRP2 to the bile. In addition, a smaller fraction of Coproporphyrin-I is excreted through urine.

This Coproporphyrin-I model is intended to be used as an endogenous marker to estimate the inhibiton constants for OATP1B1 perpetrators.

This whole-body PBPK model of Coproporphyrin-I has been developed using published pharmacokinetic clinical data by Mori 2020 ([Mori 2020](#5-references)), Takehara 2018 ([Takehara 2018](#5-references)), Lai 2016 ([Lai 2016](#5-references)) and Zhang 2020 ([Zhang 2020](#5-references)). 
The model has then been evaluated by simulating clinical studies and comparing with respective observed data. 
The clinical data included both baseline and drug-drug interaction (DDI) studies.   

The presented model includes the following features:

- transport by OATP1B1/B3,
- transport by MRP2
- renal clearance by glomerular filtration,
- intracellular liver synthesis modeled as a zero-order infusion.
